Hello hocam,

-FIRST TASK-

We chose to update the information we got from the API for services to achieve some background task. After 24 hours,
the API updates its data automatically and pushes notification.Since the API we use is related to the countries, there is rarely a change in
the data. That's why we chose 24 hours.For you to see this notification easily, we have made the duration of this 15
(we can assign this lowest time value) minutes for now.



-SECOND TASK-

We automatically send a notification every 24 hours to the user to actively use the application. For you to see this notification easily,
we have made the duration of this 1 minute for now.


 -THIRD TASK-

We showed the battery and connectivity status to the user with two icons on the right of the appbar.
